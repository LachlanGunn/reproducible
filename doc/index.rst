Introduction
============

The :mod:`reproducible` module for Python provides tools to aid in performing
reproducible scientific computations.

By supporting a more functional style of programming, we allow parameters to
be described at the top level of a computation. This will allow us to make
full use of the literate programming capabilities provided by PythonTeX without
either a long wait every time we compile or external result caches that must
be kept in sync.
